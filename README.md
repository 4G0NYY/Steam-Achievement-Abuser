# Steam Achievement Abuser

- Based on: https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager

# How does it work?
It works basically identical to the Steam Achievement Manager that can be found on Github, too. But instead of you having to manually go through each game, it automates that for you. In order to prevent Steam from crashing at around ~800 finished Games, there's a 5 Second Delay between each game that's "abused".

# What is it?
This Program is the fastest (reliable) way of getting every single Achievement for every single one of your games on Steam. 

# How to use:
1. Download latest release [from here](https://github.com/4G0NYY/Steam-Achievement-Abuser/releases)
2. Unpack in some folder
3. Start Steam 
4. Start Steam Achievement Abuser.exe
5. Press any button when the Program asks you to do so in oder to start it!
# Done!

Enjoy! :)

# You don't trust my pre-compiled .exe?
No Problem! After all, it's always more secure to compile a program yourself. In order to compile this little tool, you will need:
1. [Dotnet SDK](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/cb56b18a-e2a6-4f24-be1d-fc4f023c9cc8/be3822e20b990cf180bb94ea8fbc42fe/dotnet-sdk-8.0.101-win-x64.exe)

## How to compile: 
1. Install Dotnet
2. Download the Source Code and unzip it into a folder.
3. Open a CMD-Window and cd into the Source-Directory (e.g: cd C:\Users\testuser\Desktop\SteamAchievementAbuser)
4. Type the following into your CMD-Window: "dotnet build"
5. The Dotnet build-process should only take a few seconds. After that, you'll find a new Folder inside of your Directory called "bin". In there will be another folder called "Debug"
6. In there are all the Executables you'll need! You will need "SAM.API.dll", "Steam Achievement Abuser App.exe" and "Steam Achievement Abuser.exe". You can delete the rest.
7. Now simply open "Steam Achievement Abuser.exe" and it should work!
