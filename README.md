# Steam Achievement Abuser

- Based on: https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager

# How does it work?
It works basically identical to the Steam Achievement Manager that can be found on Github, too. But instead of you having to manually go through each game, it automates that for you. In order to prevent Steam from crashing at around ~800 finished Games, there's a 5 Second Delay between each game that's "abused".

# What is it?
This Program is the fastest (reliable) way of getting every single Achievement for every single one of your games on Steam. 

# How to use:
1. Download latest release [from here](https://github.com/4G0NYY/Steam-Achievement-Abuser/releases)
2. Unpack in some folder
3. Start Steam 
4. Start Steam Achievement Abuser.exe
5. Press any button when the Program asks you to do so in oder to start it!
# Done!

Enjoy! :)
